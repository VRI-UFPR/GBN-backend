Since the provided code is a list of imports and a declaration of an `__all__` variable without any functional logic or classes to test directly, it's not possible to write unit tests for this specific piece of code. Unit tests are typically written for functions, methods, or classes that contain logic or behavior that can be tested in isolation. 

However, if you have any specific functionality within the controllers mentioned (e.g., methods within `jornal_controller`, `exemplar_controller`, etc.) that you would like to test, please provide the code for those functionalities, and I can help you write unit tests for them. 

Unit tests for controllers often involve testing the endpoints for correct behavior, such as:
- Verifying that the correct status code is returned (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found).
- Checking that the expected data is returned in the response.
- Ensuring that the correct exceptions are raised for invalid inputs.
- Mocking dependencies like database connections or external services to test the controller logic in isolation.

If you have specific methods or functionalities within these controllers that you'd like to test, please provide more details or code snippets for those, and I'll be happy to assist with writing unit tests.
