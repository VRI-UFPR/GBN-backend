# __init__.py: Router Configuration

## Overview

This document describes the router configuration for a Python application, detailing the import and registration of various routers associated with different controllers within the application.

## Process Flow

```mermaid
graph TD
    Import[jornal_router, exemplar_router, pagina_router, texto_ocr_router, texto_correcao_manual_router, usuario_router, pontuacao_router, alternativa_router, pergunta_router]
    Register[__all__ list registration]

    Import --> Register
```

## Insights

- The file serves as a central point for importing and registering routers from different controllers, facilitating their management and accessibility.
- Each router is associated with a specific controller, indicating a modular approach to handling different aspects of the application such as journal entries, exemplars, pages, OCR texts, manual text corrections, users, scores, alternatives, and questions.
- The `__all__` list explicitly declares the routers that are available for import when the package is imported elsewhere, enhancing code readability and maintainability.
