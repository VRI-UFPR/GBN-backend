- Each record in the CSV file corresponds to a specific edition of a journal, with fields capturing essential bibliographic and physical characteristics.
- The `metadados` field likely contains information about the physical dimensions of the journal edition, suggesting that the data structure could be used in contexts where physical storage or printing considerations are relevant.
- The inclusion of `idioma_predominante` (predominant language) implies that the journals may cater to a multilingual audience or have editions in different languages.
- The structure is simple and straightforward, making it easy to parse and manipulate using standard CSV processing tools or libraries in various programming languages.
